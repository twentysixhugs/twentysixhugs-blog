Hello, and welcome to my first blog post! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences with you all. In this post, I want to talk about my journey into web development. It's been a challenging but rewarding experience, and I hope that my story can inspire others who are just starting out. I first became interested in web development a few years ago when I was working on a personal project. I wanted to build a simple website to showcase my work, but I had no idea where to start.

I began by reading articles and tutorials online, and eventually stumbled upon a course that taught me the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was hooked!

Of course, learning to code is never easy. There were many times when I felt frustrated and discouraged, and I even considered giving up. But I kept at it, and with each passing day, I felt myself getting a little bit better. I started building more complex projects and contributing to open source projects.

## What's Next?

Now that I've gained some experience in web development, I'm excited to see where this journey takes me. I've already learned so much, but I know that there's still so much more to learn.

In future blog posts, I plan to share some of the projects I'm working on, as well as some tips and tricks for learning to code.

## Here's the code which renders the code

```tsx
const components = {
  // Define a custom component for rendering code blocks
  code: ({
    className,
    children,
  }: {
    className?: string;
    children?: ReactNode;
  }) => {
    // Extract the language from the class name (e.g. "language-jsx" -> "jsx")
    const language = className?.replace("language-", "") || "javascript";

    // Use ReactDOMServer to convert the React children to an HTML string
    const codeHtml = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(
      <div style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>{children}</div>
    );

    //eslint-disable-next-line
    const ref = useRef<HTMLElement | null>(null);

    //eslint-disable-next-line
    useLayoutEffect(() => {
      if (!ref.current) return;

      ref.current.innerHTML = `${codeHtml}`;
    }, [ref.current]);

    return (
      <pre>
        <code
          style={{ borderRadius: "12px", background: "#13111c" }}
          ref={ref}
          className={`hljs ${language}`}
        ></code>
      </pre>
    );
  },
};
```
